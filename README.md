Hello, I am Maksuda Islam Lima, an undergraduate final year Software Engineering Student of Islamic University of Technology. In my 7th semester, 4-1, there is a 9 credit course which is based on doing an internship in an IT Company. Some professors from our university have helped us to get through the recruitment process. One among them forwarded my CV to Nascenia IT Limited, an award winning software company working for European and North American clients. 
<br>
Nascenia reviewed our CVs and called upon an online interview within a very short period. Despite having a personal dissatisfaction with my performance in the interview, it was still quite a knowledagble experience. Later on, I was delighted to know that I was one of the chosen candidates to start working as an intern at Nascenia IT Limited.
<br>
I, along with 4 other batchmates of mine joined Nascenia on 8th March, 2021 and went to their office for the first time to get a warm welcome from the executives and later on was introduced to our respective supervisors through a video call by the CTO of the company. 
Luckily, I got two of the most organised and most helpful supervisors one could ever ask for. 
<br>
During the intership period with the help of my supervisors' guidance I learned many new technologies, programming languages and not to mention got comfortable with a new OS for me which is Ubuntu!
<br>
Before starting the intership I had little knowledge of ReactJS, so my supervisor, Raziur Rahman bhaiya, decided to start the journey by polishing the ReactJS and JS itself.
