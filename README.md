<h1>Journey of my first Internship at Nascenia IT Limited</h1>

<h3> <em> About me & how I got this opportunity </h3>

Hello, I am Maksuda Islam Lima, an undergraduate final year Software Engineering Student of the Islamic University of Technology. In my 7th semester, 4-1, there is a 9 credit course that is based on doing an internship in an IT Company. Some professors from our university have helped us to get through the recruitment process. One of them forwarded my CV to <a href="https://nascenia.com/">Nascenia IT Limited</a>, an award-winning software company working for European and North American clients. 
<br>
<br>
<h3> <em> Interview Experience </h3>
Nascenia reviewed our CVs and called upon an online interview within a very short period. Despite having a personal dissatisfaction with my performance in the interview, it was still quite a knowledgeable experience. Later on, I was informed about the confirmation of my selection in Nascenia IT Limited as a web development (functioning unit) intern.
<br>
<br>
<h3> <em> First day at Office </h3>
I, along with 4 other batchmates of mine joined Nascenia on 8th March 2021 and went to their office for the first time to get a warm welcome from the executives and later was introduced to our respective supervisors through a video call by the CTO of the company. 
Luckily, I got two of the most organized and most helpful supervisors one could ever ask for. 
<br>
<h3><em> How it started </h3>
During the internship period with the help of my supervisors' guidance, I learned many new technologies, programming languages and not to mention got comfortable with a new(for me) OS which is Ubuntu!
<br>
Before starting the internship I had little knowledge of ReactJS, so my supervisor, Raziur Rahman bhaiya, decided to start the journey by polishing the ReactJS and JS itself. 
<br>
<br>
<h3><em> First thing to learn, ReactJS & JS </h3>
As the journey started I was given resources to learn <strong>React</strong> and practice small problems of React from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#react">FreeCodeCamp</a>.
After this, the next task was to solve <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-algorithm-scripting">Basic Algorithm Scripting</a> from <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong>, along with that I used to read resources like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects">MDN</a> to acquire knowledge about the built-in functions of JavaScripts. Subsequently started doing <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting">Intermediate Algorithm Scripting</a> not to mention from <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong> which gave me a hard time solving. During those days, I remember being told by a supervisor of mine to start thinking as a JavaScript developer! 
<br>
<br>
<h3><em> ReactTS & TypeScript </h3>
The phase of solving problems and doing exercises from <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong> ends here. Afterward, I had indulged in learning <strong>TypeScript</strong> both class-based and component-based. Made a small <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/counter-reactts">counter</a> using TypeScripts on platforms like <em>Stackbiltz</em>. Introduced myself with fast prototyping using web-based tools like CodeSandBox, CodePen, and Stackbiltz. 
<br>
<br>
<h3><em>An important fundamental thing of web development, html & css, which we neglect the most </h3>
Worked a bit on a previously done React app by this time was assigned to make a small responsive static landing page using HTML and CSS only
which was given as an intermediate level challenge on <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN">FrontEnd Mentor</a>.
<em>I have attached the screenshots of my project to check how it looks like</em>
here's the deployed project link
<a href="https://kima063.github.io/Easy-Bank-Landing-Page//">Here!</a>
<br>
<br>
Then I was again given to learn <strong>CSS</strong> properly from an interactive coding learning platform, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css">Codecademy</a>. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><em> Got to learn how commercial huge project works, for a small span tho, got the chance to polish my bootstrap & github game too! </h3>
Latter was assigned to a project of the company called 'Industlink' to work on the frontend part under the supervision of my TTF. I was given this project's one role's Figma design to broke it down into code, later integrated it into the original project(few parts). During this task, I learned many things about frontend development, a tiny bit of Ruby on Rails and so many important things about GitHub and its workflow from my TTF and my other supervisor Rezaul Karim bhai.
<br>
<br>
<h3><em> Here comes the learning experience of the solution "it works fine on my machine" </h3>
Then I learned the <strong>docker basics</strong> and to get a complete overview dockerized a nodejs <a href="https://github.com/kima063/nodejs-docker">web app</a>.
<br>
<br>
<h3><em> Took a look to another huge E-Commerce project </h3>
After that, went through the <a href="https://demo.saleor.io/">Saleor.io E-Commerce website</a> to get an overview of <strong>complete full-stack JavaScript web development</strong>.
<br>
<br>

<h3><em> A small React app, did some practicing there </h3>
Again was assigned to do an advanced level challenge of <strong>Frontend Mentor</strong> which is a react app called "Rest-Countries".
Here is the deployed link of that app is <a href="https://kima063.github.io/rest-countries/">Here!</a>
<br>
<br>
<h3><em> Here comes a pretty interresting one for me, got to learn Django! </h3>
Completing the react app I started learning <strong>Django</strong> and made a small app following the tutorial of <em>MDN Web Docs</em> and later deployed it using <em>Heroku</em>. 
The deployed link of that app is <a href="https://limitless-ravine-76607.herokuapp.com/">Here!</a>
<br>
<br>
<h3><em> Well, Why leaving behind the Rest APIs right? </h3>
Learned how to make Rest API using django as well, followed a tutorial app again and later deployed it using heroku.
One can check it out from this link <a href="https://sheltered-thicket-81037.herokuapp.com/">Here!</a>
<br>
<h3>Graphql added to the list</h3>
Graphql is a must after learning rest apis, all the hassles one need to go through for the CRUD opt using rest api are solved by graphql. 
I really enjoyed reading this one! I made a small thingy following <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/tutorial-plain/">this</a> tutorial.
